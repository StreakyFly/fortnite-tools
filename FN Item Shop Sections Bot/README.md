This bot is constantly checking for Fortnite Item Shop Section/tab changes. If it detects a change, it posts it.
There are two versions (the main difference is in what order they sort the sections:
 - sort by text length (shortest to longest => top to bottom)
 - sort by least recently used (the longer the section hasn't been in the shop, the higher it will appear)

The code is absolutely terrific. Enjoy decrypting it if anything breaks... Sorry.

Here's how the tweets look like.

1. Sorted by text length:
