Leave this on 'False' unless you know how to download "wxPython" library. If any errors occur, turn this to False.
This option sorts Shop Sections by text length measured in pixels rather than by the quantity of characters.
This will rarely make any difference and if it does, it will be minimal.

class Platform:
    wxPython_library = False  # if set to True, it will sort sections by text length, otherwise by character quantity
